## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: We say python as high level programming language because it is easy for humans to understand.Python is called as general purpose because python is used for wide variety of 
development tasks like Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence etc.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python is called dynamically typed because we dont declare the type of variable prior and it dont know before the code is run.Due to dynamic typing, in Python the same variable can have a different type at different times during the execution.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Advatanges of Python:
Python is easy to learn and read.
Python is open source.
Python is dynamically typed.
Python is free and open source.
Disadvanatges of Python:
Slow speed
Consumes lot of memory
Python is not suited for mobile.


Q4. In what all domains can we use python?
Ans:Python can bw used in various domains like:
Data Engineering
Machine Learning
Data Science
Artificial Inteligence
Deep Learning
Game Development
Web development


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans:Variables are used for storing values in memory location in Python.
The first character of the variable can be an alphabet or _ underscore.
Special characters @, #, %, ^, &, * should not be used in variable name.
Variable names are case sensitive. For example  age and AGE are two different variables.
Reserve words cannot be declared as variables.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans:By using input("Enter the value").Input function is used for taking input from user.


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans: By default python uses String data type if we dont specify.


Q8. What is type casting?

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Q10. What are keywords?

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.

```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
